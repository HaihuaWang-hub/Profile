# Research Overview

My research focuses on three major themes:

## 1. Mycorrhizal-Mediated Nutrient Cycling

Investigating how ectomycorrhizal fungi regulate iron acquisition, nitrogen flux, and soil organic matter decomposition.

## 2. Heavy Metal Stress & Symbiotic Adaptation

Understanding fungal-mediated detoxification and plant adaptation mechanisms under contaminated environments.

## 3. Microbiome Engineering & Synthetic Communities

Developing SynCom-based interventions to mitigate soil-borne diseases and enhance crop resilience.

## Methodological Framework

- Multi-omics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics)
- X-ray fluorescence imaging
- NanoSIMS & FISH
- Bioinformatics pipeline development
- Geospatial ecological modeling
